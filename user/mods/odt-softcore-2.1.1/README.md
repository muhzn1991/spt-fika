# Experimental single player Tarkov "survival RPG vibes" rebalance focused on economy and crafting with a sprinkle of random extra features. 

BETA VERSION. WORK IN PROGRESS. Looking for community feedback. Use at your own risk. New profile highly recommended. 

## Flea market rebalance features: 
- "Pacifist" flea market (and Fence), only meds, barter items, food and info items can be bought.
- Random barter ONLY economy - you can only purchase those items on the flea using FIR (or crafted) items.
- Items you can barter with are also from food, meds, info and barter categories only. 
- "Live" flea prices are completely removed and matched to in-game BSG handbook (Traders) data. 
- You cannot sell items on flea anymore. 

This results in major change of gameplay dynamic. 
Now Tarkov feels like a proper single player focused survival game.
Begone "most profit per slot" mentality.
Begone "rush to lvl 15" to run meta gear only.

All items, even the cheapest, are somewhat valuable now. 
Ever thought about looting AA batteries or Crickents? 
Well, now you will actually look for them to trade in similar value tiers on flea. 

Barters are random and vary a lot in value. 
This results in higly engaging simulation of a war broken society, with some wild trades included. 
Trully immersive experience.

Hideout crafts are great and usefull (toilet paper craft nerfed, was too OP).

Leveling traders and crafting is your only hope of survival. 

## Hideout features:
- 100x faster hideout construction.
- 100x faster hiteout crafts.
- 10x faster bitcoin mining, purified water and moonshine production.
- 10x bigger fuel draw to compensate. (Now you will have to think about fuel. A little, but still.)
- New crafts (Ophthalmoscope, Zagustin, CALOK, Adrenaline, 3bTG, AHF1) and rebalanced some of the vanilla ones (Clin, Paracord, Water filter, Toilet paper, EWR, MULE, Surv12, AFAK, LEDX, GRIZZLY). Working on more (Workbench and intelligence center crafts), suggestions and discussion are encouraged!
- Did you always want to run your own personal underground meth lab in Tarkov? Obdolbos is now craftable at massive profit. 

## Various tweaks:
- Flea is open on level 5.
- Reshala always has his Golden TT.
- Remove backpack restrictions (for containers [ammo, med, etc] mostly). Never again I'll see an unlootable medcase in 314.
- 5x faster item examine time.
- Redo insurance. Prapor is an instant return with 50% chance, costs 10% of item value, Therapist has 2 hour return with 80% chance, costs 20%.
- Keytool buff to make it 5x5.
- Buff to SICC case to make it actually better and a direct upgrade to Docs. And while we are here, allow it to hold keytool. It's Softcore, who cares.
- Buff Vitality, Sniper and Surgery skill leveling (looking for more input)
- Random-only QUEST keys are availiable on flea
- Small list of items used in crafts is availiable on flea (and headsets. Because it's mostly preference, cmon.)
- Custom config for HIGLY recommended mod - [TRAP'S PROGRESSIVE STASH](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/917-trap-s-progressive-stash-3-4-0-temp). You will need the space.
- Bigger Ammo Stacks x10

## Configuration:
Extencive configuration for EVERY option in config.json

## Notes:
- No, you cannot use your new fastly mined bitcoins for barters. Because of well, reasons. Like inflation, man. It hits all of us. No one cares about crypto anymore, except you and your nerd friend Mechanic.
